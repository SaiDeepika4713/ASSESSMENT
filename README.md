DESIGN APPROACH: In designing an automated room control system, we aim to seamlessly integrate various components such as the AC, fan, lights, windows, electrical appliances, routers, and a fire alert system to enhance comfort, safety, and energy efficiency.

COMPONENT SPECIFICATIONS:

1.USER INPUT: Users can modify settings or initiate certain operations by pressing physical push buttons or switches. With the keypad, users can enter numbers or select options by hitting particular keys.

2.WIFI MODULE: The ESP8266 and ESP32 are popular Wi-Fi modules that are frequently used with Arduino. These modules provide a number of capabilities appropriate for Internet of Things and automation projects, are reasonably priced, and have strong support.

3.ROOM SENSORS: Sensors that measure temperature in the room allow the HVAC system (fan and AC) to be precisely controlled. By detecting when people are present or absent, occupancy sensors help optimize energy use by modifying HVAC, lighting, and other systems. Light sensors work in tandem with window controls to optimize natural light and assess ambient light levels to modify artificial lighting. When smoke or fire is detected, a fire alert system is activated, and safety precautions are taken.

4.ARDUINO UNO BOARD: Utilizing the ESP32's improved features, like its increased processing power, number of GPIO pins, and communication interfaces, to create a room control system with more features.

5.ACTUATORS: 

•	Smart Switches (for Lights and Electrical Appliances): The most common ways to operate smart switches are either Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. To communicate with these smart switches, we can utilize Bluetooth or Wi-Fi modules compatible with Arduino (such as the ESP8266 and ESP32). The smart switch manufacturers give libraries and APIs that we can use to include their products into the Arduino-based control system.

•	Motorized Window Control: An Arduino's digital or analog output pins can be used to control servo motors or motorized actuators. The Arduino IDE's Servo library can be used to provide fine control when working with servo motors. We should make sure the Arduino can handle the motors' power requirements, or use external power sources.

•	Smart HVAC Controllers(for AC and Fan): Wi-Fi-enabled gadgets are often fan controllers and smart thermostats. To communicate with these devices, connect Wi-Fi modules that are compatible with Arduino. Integration can be accomplished via the APIs that the manufacturers of the fan controllers or smart thermostats give.

•	Fire Alert Systems: Audible and visual alarms can be triggered by digital output pins on the Arduino. Connect alarms directly to the Arduino's output pins or through relay modules for better isolation. Ensure proper power supply and consider safety measures when dealing with alarms.

6.POWER RELAY BOARD: A power relay board becomes essential when we need to control high-power devices, such as the electrical appliances, using a low-power microcontroller like Arduino.

7.USER INTERFACE(FOR CONTROL AND FEEDBACK): Touchscreen displays can be connected to Arduino using dedicated display libraries (e.g., Adafruit GFX, TFT_eSPI). LEDs can be controlled through digital output pins on the Arduino. User inputs on the touchscreen can be used to trigger actions or change settings in the room automation system.
